The main duty is to help freshman get familiar with life and lessons about university. As I graduated from the school of information, I'm familiar with both life and lessons here.

Lesson
======
Help people with problems on math and CS classes.


Life
======
Introduce our university and some points I find through my bachelor period. Any problems in life, they can ask me for help.

Psychological care
======
As university care about the psychological health of students, I talked to them and provide suggestions to address psychological problems (pressure, insomia etc).
