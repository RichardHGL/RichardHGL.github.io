I am a PhD candidate in [wis group](http://wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/), TU Delft, supervised by Prof.dr. [Ujwal Gadiraju](http://ujwalgadiraju.com/) and Prof.dr.ir. [Geert-Jan Houben](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7SLMWEcAAAAJ&hl=en). 
I obtained my master and bachelor degree from Information School at Renmin University of China ([RUC](https://ruc.edu.cn/)), supervised by Prof.dr. [Wayne Xin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JNhNacoAAAAJ) and Prof.dr. [Ji-Rong Wen](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=tbxCHJgAAAAJ). I also worked as a visiting research student in Singapore Management University, supervised by Prof.dr. [Jing Jiang](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/jingjiang/). 

Research Interest
======
In my master program, I primarily focused on deep learning techniques for graph representation learning and reasoning, and on intelligent applications
with relational knowledge bases, such as knowledge base question answering, knowledge graph completion, and knowledge-based recommender systems.

My current research focuses on human-centered AI:
- Collecting necessary human knowledge (e.g., commonsense knowledge) to improve AI systems and generate explanations
- Designing effective explanation methods (e.g., using analogy) to facilitate human-AI collaboration (target users: laypeople, non-experts)
- Analyzing user factors (e.g., expertise, mindset) in shaping trust and reliance in human-AI collaboration.
