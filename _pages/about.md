I am a PhD candidate in [wis group](http://wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/), TU Delft, supervised by Prof.dr. [Ujwal Gadiraju](http://ujwalgadiraju.com/) and Prof.dr.ir. [Geert-Jan Houben](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7SLMWEcAAAAJ&hl=en). 
I obtained my master and bachelor degree from Information School at Renmin University of China ([RUC](https://ruc.edu.cn/)), supervised by Prof.dr. [Wayne Xin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JNhNacoAAAAJ) and Prof.dr. [Ji-Rong Wen](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=tbxCHJgAAAAJ). I also visited Singapore Management University and the University of Queensland.

Research Interest
======
In my master program, I primarily focused on deep learning techniques for graph representation learning and reasoning, and on intelligent applications
with relational knowledge bases, such as knowledge base question answering, knowledge graph completion, and knowledge-based recommender systems.

My current research focuses on human-centered AI:
- Exploring how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can collaborate with humans to boost work efficiency and optimize workflow.
- Analyzing user factors (e.g., **cognitive bias**) in shaping **trust and reliance** in human-AI collaboration.
- Designing effective explanation methods (e.g., using **analogy**) to facilitate human-AI collaboration (target users: laypeople, non-experts)
- Collecting necessary human knowledge (e.g., **commonsense knowledge**) to improve AI systems and generate explanations
