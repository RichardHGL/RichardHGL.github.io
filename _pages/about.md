I am a Ms student in Information School at Renmin University of China (RUC), advised by Prof. [Wayne Xin Zhao](http://playbigdata.ruc.edu.cn/batmanfly/) and [Ji-Rong Wen](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=tbxCHJgAAAAJ). I also worked as a visiting research student in Singapore Management University, supervised by Prof. [Jing Jiang](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/jingjiang/). I received my Bachelor's Degree from [RUC](https://ruc.edu.cn/), in 2018.
