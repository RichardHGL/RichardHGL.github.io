In this paper, we have proposed a novel Taxonomy-aware Multi-hop Reasoning Network (TMRN) for better understandin2g-haonpd modeling user preference for sequential recommendation. We have associated the learning of user preferences with the category hierarchy. [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3289600.3290972), [code](https://github.com/RUCDM/TMRN)
